# Decision Tree Optimization and Analysis

This repository houses a Jupyter notebook dedicated to the exploration and optimization of decision tree models. The notebook delves into parameter tuning, model evaluation, and feature importance analysis, providing a structured approach to understanding and enhancing decision tree performance.

## Overview

The project's cornerstone is a detailed Jupyter notebook that guides readers through the process of optimizing a decision tree model. It begins with data preparation, moves on to parameter tuning using cross-validation, and concludes with a thorough evaluation of the model's performance.

### Features

- **Data Preparation:** Steps for loading, cleaning, and splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets.
- **Parameter Tuning:** Utilizes 5-fold cross-validation to tune key parameters such as max_depth, max_leaf_nodes, and alpha, exploring suitable value ranges for each.
- **Model Evaluation:** Analysis of the optimal decision tree model, focusing on accuracy, the confusion matrix, and identifying the model's most important features.

### Highlights

- A focused approach to parameter tuning for decision trees, exploring a comprehensive range of values for critical parameters.
- Detailed model performance evaluation, providing insights into accuracy and feature importance.
- Practical demonstrations of data preparation and analysis techniques applicable in broader machine learning contexts.
